## Objective

The objective of this project was to implement Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) configurations for secure remote access to SSH and PostgreSQL services using OpenZiti. By deploying ZTNA, the project aimed to eliminate traditional VPN dependencies, enhance security by enforcing identity-based authentication, and ensure that access to critical services is granted based on granular policies. This implementation focused on securing network traffic between clients and services without exposing them to the public internet, thereby mitigating potential attack vectors.

### Skills Learned

- Configuration and management of OpenZiti for Zero Trust Network Access
- Secure tunneling of SSH and database connections over ZTNA
- Identity-based authentication and access control implementation
- Network troubleshooting and debugging secure connections
- Working with PostgreSQL in a Zero Trust environment

### Tools Used

- OpenZiti – For implementing ZTNA policies and securing access
- AlmaLinux – Server environment for hosting SSH and PostgreSQL services
- Windows PowerShell – For remote access and executing commands
- PostgreSQL – Database management system used in the implementation
- Ziti Desktop Edge – For managing secure connections through ZTNA
